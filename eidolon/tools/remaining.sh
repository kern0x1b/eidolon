remaining.sh ROOT TYPE...: a name-level work list for a slice, for when a dump is not to hand.
Greps our sources for each name, so it is coarser than tools/slice-diff.py and is a cross-check.
# remaining.sh: Apple's 26.2 declarations for a slice of types that our sources do not name at all.
# Name-level, not signature-level: the digester dump behind slice-diff.py is a build-adjacent job, and
# this is a light check. A name it reports may still exist with another spelling, so it is a work list.

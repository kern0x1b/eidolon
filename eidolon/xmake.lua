-- must not be left running: it holds the shared package lock while it waits for the next one.

-- Every weak import the program and the runtime it carries make is answered behind a check: the
-- runtime's overlays are compiled with availability checking on, so a call to later API stands behind
-- #available, and Styx's own _CFRunLoopTimerSetTolerance is answered by the backports this program
-- carries. Stated once so each target does not repeat it.
--
-- Unmeasured, and said so: the check that would remove this waiver runs after the link, and this
-- port is not linked yet - the packages it takes are in no released repository, so a build of it
-- resolves them from a checkout into the shared store, which is not this repository's to do. What
-- the waiver claims is what apple.runtime_guards records for the runtime and what the backports
-- answer for Styx; a build without it either confirms that and the waiver goes, or names a weak
-- import the table does not record, which is a row the table is missing.
-- Inside a target() scope xmake binds that target's API as globals and there is no `self` - measured,
-- `self` in a target scope is nil - so a helper that took the target was handed nil and indexed it. The
-- scope's own add_values is what can be handed over instead: it is already bound to this target, so the
-- sentence is written once and every target gets it.

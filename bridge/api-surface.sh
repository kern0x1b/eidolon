# Dumps the API of Apple's SwiftUI (the iOS 16.4 interface, through the patched copy in fw/) and of the module built
# by ../eidolon/build.sh with swift-api-digester, and lists Apple's declarations that have no counterpart with the
# same signature, and the other way round: the public names this module has that Apple's own 26.2 interface does not
# declare, which is a failure. DIR (default ./api) receives apple.json, ours.json, gaps.txt and invented.txt;
# api-diff.py and api-invented.py explain the columns.

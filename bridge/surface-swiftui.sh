# Apple's 26.2 surface, for the gate in api-invented.py: the interfaces of the modules Eidolon declares
# against, and of every module those reach through their `@_exported import` lines, which the walker
# follows itself. The entry list is where the walk starts, not what it reads: a module SwiftUI
# re-exports and the list does not name is walked anyway.
#
# The output is a data file. api-invented.py is an error without it — a gate that quietly swapped its
# own oracle would be a gate nobody could trust — and this script is how it is written.

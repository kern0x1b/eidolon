# snapshots.sh [--accept]: render the snapshot scenarios in the emulated device and compare them with
# eidolon/Snapshots/reference. The scenarios need a key window and SpringBoard's own lifecycle, so they
# are the demo application built as the snapshot bundle (the same sources, another Info.plist) and
# started through SpringBoard by xmake emulate launch; until-exit holds the guest until it has rendered
# them all and quit. Every scenario is drawn as well as dumped, so the picture can be looked at.
# ONLY=<name> renders one scenario: it is a key of the bundle's Info.plist, so the port is configured
# with it and the bundle rebuilt.
